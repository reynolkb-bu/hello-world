This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I'm Kyle. I'm a software engineering manager with over 9 years of experience in software. The first half of my career I was in client facing roles like implementation and consulting. The last half of my career I moved into more technical roles like software engineering. I use Java on a daily basis.
